## Questions for the team:

    -Can there be a contest without an image? If yes, would we use a default artist image? If yes, -Can there be an artist without an image?
    -For MVP are we supporting multiple contests for a single artists? My vote is no because it keeps us from needing to contest selection page for now.
    -For Michael, where does this tool fit in the MM funnel? Are we between manychat and clickfunnels or somewhere else completely?


    -For ActionPointsButton : can we abstract this component away to simply be 1) action type 2) completed or incomplete and then let all of the color decisions be made from there?
