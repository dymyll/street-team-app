## other todo items:

    - for previews (on artist facing create contest pages) can we pass in actions based on the check boxes? For now, let's automatically update the page when the user checks the checkboxes

### ReactDeadline.js - opt in card

    //const countDownStartDate = new Date(startDate).getTime();
    make sure we're using UTC with Javascript Date and respect user's timezone

## Questions for the team:

    -For MVP are we supporting multiple contests for a single artists? My vote is no because it keeps us from needing to contest selection page for now.
    -For Michael, where does this tool fit in the MM funnel? Are we between manychat and clickfunnels or somewhere else completely?


    -For ActionPointsButton : can we abstract this component away to simply be 1) action type 2) completed or incomplete and then let all of the color decisions be made from there?
